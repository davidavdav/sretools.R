Title: Compute error metrics and make DET plots for NIST-like Speaker Recognition Evaluations

Description: This package contains a set of routines that can compute various
 performance measures for NIST style speaker recognition evaluation
 system output.  The routines in this package allow
 - trial key info sore SRE 2006, 2008 and EVALITA 2009
 - flexible plotting of DET curves
 - calculation of EER, minCdet, Cdet, minCllr and Cllr
 - adding legends to the plot in the order of the EER
 - plotting APE-plots, with proper legend
 - merging of meta-information to the scores, and manipulation of
   these tables
 - conditioning trials on meta-information 
 - weighting trials based on a chosen conditioning, before calculation
   of DET parameters and performance metrics.  This is pretty new,
   although George Doddington's DET_tools.pm has similar capability.
